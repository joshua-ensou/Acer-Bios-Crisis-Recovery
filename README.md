## Recovery Steps

### 1) Download the Oldest BIOS for Your Laptop Model

- Go to the official website for your laptop model and download the oldest BIOS version available.
    

### 2) Extract the Files

- Use WinRAR or any extraction tool to extract the files from the downloaded archive.
    

### 3) Clear Temporary Files

- Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog, then type `%temp%` and hit **Enter**.
    
- Alternatively, you can navigate to `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
    
- Delete all the files in this folder. These files are temporary, and it's safe to delete them.
    

### 4) Run the Executable File

- Locate and run the BIOS executable file (e.g., `BIOS_V1.03.exe`).
    
- The program will likely run but show an error message. Do not close the error messages.
    

### 5) Check the Temp Folder

- Go back to the Temp folder (`%temp%` or `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\AppData\Local\Temp\`).
    
- Look for a newly created folder, such as `7zS107B.tmp` (the name will vary depending on the BIOS update).
    

### 6) Copy the .FD or .BIN File

- Inside the new folder, find the `.FD` file (e.g., `KL_BIOS_V1.03_Release.fd`). Some BIOS updates may contain a file named `isflashb.bin`.
    
- Copy this file to a USB drive that is formatted as FAT32. This should be the only file on the USB drive.
    
- **Tip:** Use a USB drive with an LED activity indicator to monitor if the motherboard detects and reads the USB drive.
    

### 7) Rename the BIOS File

- Rename the `.FD` file (e.g., `KL_BIOS_V1.03_Release.fd`) to `BIOS.fd`, or rename `isflashb.bin` to `BIOS.fd`.
    

### 8) Check the BIOS File Naming Pattern (if applicable)

- Some BIOS files follow a specific naming pattern, which can be checked by opening the `.FD` or `.BIN` file in a hex editor.
    
    1. Download and launch **HxD** (a hex editor).
        
    2. Open the `.FD` file or the `isflashb.bin` file.
        
    3. Use the "Search" function and search for the string `.fd`.
        
    4. Click **Search** until you find entries like `ME.fd`, `BIOS.fd`.
        
    5. Some BIOS files may have names like `C050P0R0H0x64.FD`. Remove the zeros to get `C5PRHx64.FD`.
        

### 9) Power Reset the Laptop

- On your corrupted BIOS laptop, **remove the battery** and **unplug the power cord** for 15 seconds to perform a power reset.
    
- After 15 seconds, plug the battery and charger back in.
    

### 10) Initiate BIOS Recovery

- Plug the USB drive into the laptop.
    
- Press and hold **Fn + Esc** and then press the **power button**.
    
- The screen will remain blank, and the CPU fan will run at full speedâ€”this is normal.
    
- Observe the USB drive's LED activity; it should be flashing in the background. The laptop will stay in this state until the flashing stops.
    

### 11) Wait for the Reboot

- Once the flashing stops, the laptop will automatically reboot.
    
- Some laptops will shut off by themselves during this process and need to be turned on manually.
    
- The laptop will display a black screen for about 3 minutes and then shut down.
    
- Press the power button to turn the laptop on again.
    

### 12) Successful Boot

- If the recovery was successful, you should see the **Acer logo** and the laptop will boot into Windows or the BIOS.
    

### 13) Enjoy Your Revived Acer Laptop

- Congratulations, your laptop should now be revived and working properly!
